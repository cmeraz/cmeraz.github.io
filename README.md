# Projects for Fun!

All the files and code made in this project repository is just for practice all kind of funny suff on HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Right now im working on a Whatsapp Message app to send messages to an specific number via web interface, with it im just learning how forms workd, a little bit of styling by css and some functionality made with Javascript, things to manipulate de DOM, like getting data from inputs, validate the data, liseting for events like clicks or keys pressed.
